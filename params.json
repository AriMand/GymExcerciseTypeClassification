This data is being used to train a model to classify the way of excersise in to the given categories\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the dataset is availabel in the following link.\r\nhttp://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har\r\n\r\nYou can load the data using the following rscript (replace the file location with your own file location)\r\n```{r}\r\ncsv.data <- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Aritra\\\\Desktop\\\\MLr\\\\pml-training.csv\");\r\ntrain <- csv.data[c(7:11,37:49,60:68,84:86,102,113:124,140,151:160)];\r\ncsv.data <- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Aritra\\\\Desktop\\\\MLr\\\\pml-testing.csv\");\r\ntest <- csv.data[c(7:11,37:49,60:68,84:86,102,113:124,140,151:159)];\r\n```\r\nThe data shows a lot of covariance among the parameters and tend to follow a data distribution pattern which can be seen bt plotting the parameters against each other using the the ggplot package in R\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n```\r\ngiven bellow are some plots of the parameters in the data using qplot function\r\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\r\nqplot( total_accel_belt,total_accel_arm,colour=classe,data=train)\r\nqplot( total_accel_arm,total_accel_forearm,colour=classe,data=train)\r\nqplot( roll_belt,pitch_forearm,colour=classe,data=train)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo a Linear discriminant analysis based model will be suitable for this kind of classication due to the high multivariate covariance of the features\r\n\r\nGiven below are the list of the features used for classification.\r\n\r\n```{r,}\r\nnames(train)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe do the modeling and cross validation using caret package\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(caret)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe keep the test set intact to run the model on it just once.\r\n\r\nWe slice the Training set into traing and test set for model building and cross validation.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ninTrain<-createDataPartition(y=train$classe,p=0.75,list=FALSE)\r\ntraining<-train[inTrain,]\r\ntesting<-train[-inTrain,]\r\ndim(training) \r\ndim(testing)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe model  is bult usign the train fuction in caret . \r\n\r\n\r\nThe range of values for the features are varied so we use centering and scaling to preprocess them make them in same range for better prediction.\r\n\r\nThe trainig method used is \"lda\"\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n\r\nmodFit<-train(classe~.,data=training,method=\"lda\",preProcess = c(\"center\", \"scale\"))\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe we use the testing  slice of the  training data to cross validate the  model.\r\n```{r}\r\nprediction<-predict(modFit,testing[-54])\r\n```\r\nwe draw a confusion matrix for the model on the cross validation data which is created by random sampling from the training data earlier\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nconfusionMatrix(testing$classe,prediction)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected out of sample error is around 65% to 70%\r\n\r\nWe fnally run it on the 20 test  samples to generate the predictions As given below,\r\n```{r}\r\nprediction<-predict(modFit,test)\r\nprint(prediction)\r\n\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
